## With Ranked Choice Voting

# You can't "waste" your vote!

### How RCV works, and why it matters.

Hello! Have you ever felt like there was a candidate you really liked, but you decided that it was better to vote for the candidate with a better chance of winning, otherwise you'd be "wasting your vote?" 

Well, Ranked Choice Voting is a way to allow you to cast a vote you know will count, without having to compromise on your political principles. 

## How Ranked Choice Voting Works when there is one winner. 

Let's look at this candidate roster: 

* Bamboot Spitvalve
    * Complete Scumbag Party
    * Policies
        * Kick puppies
        * Beat the poor
        * Mandatory pineapple on pizza
* Floundra McWhatnot
    * Discreet Scumbag Party
    * Policies
        * Put puppies to work
        * Yell at the poor
        * Mandatory pineapple on pizza except for religious exceptions.
* Gort Butterson
    * Pants-On-Head Party
    * Policies
        * Televised Puppy Torture
        * Mandatory Pencil Shavings on Pizza
        * Toot Toot, I'm a boat!
* Aggy-Waggy Flufftums
    * Nice Party
    * Policies
        * Hugs
        * A cup of nice calming tea
        * Freedom in choice of Pizza Topping.

Now, I don't know about you, but I want to vote for Nice Party. But under our winner-take-all, two-party system, the Nice Party doesn't have a real chance of winning. If I don't vote for the Discreet Scumbags, I'm "throwing my vote away" and making it more likely the Complete Scumbag Party will get elected. 

Ranked Choice Voting is different. With ranked choice voting, you can vote for the Discreet Scumbags to beat the Complete Scumbags, but still list your "#1 preference" as the Nice Party, like so: 

 [ 3 ] SPITVALVE, Bamboot, (Complete Scumbag)
 [ 2 ] MCWHATNOT, Floundra, (Discreet Scumbag)
 [ 4 ] BUTTERSON, Gort, (Pants-On-Head)
 [ 1 ] FLUFFTUMS, Aggy-Waggy (Nice)

To win a seat, a candidate under Ranked Choice Voting must end up with an **absolute majority**, that is, at least 50% of the total votes, plus 1. 

Imagine that 100 people voted. That means a candidate needs 51 votes to win. 

First, the #1 votes are counted.  

(First Count)
* Complete Scumbag: 39
* Discreet Scumbag: 35
* Nice: 20
* Pants-On-Head: 6

If this was a winner-take-all election, the Complete Scumbag would get elected.  But with ranked choice voting, the candidate with the least votes, the Pants-On-Head party candidate, is eliminated, and their #2 votes (second preferences) are counted and transferred.  Now we have:

(Second Count)
* Complete Scumbag: 39 + 4 = 43
* Discreet Scumbag: 35 + 1 = 36
* Nice: 20 + 1 = 21
* Pants-On-Head: Eliminated

Still, no one has an absolute majority of 51 or moe.  So we eliminate the last-place Nice Party candidate and transfer those votes. 

(Third Count)
* Complete Scumbag: 43 + 5 = 48
* Discreet Scumbag: 36 + 16 = 52 - ELECTED

As a result, the Discreet Scumbag candidate is elected instead of the Complete Scumbag.  

Basically, if your first choice doesn't win, your second choice gets counted as your first choice, and so on.  

Now, you may ask, if your second-choice won anyway, what's the point of putting the Nice Party first? Well, that's just this example.  Minor parties and independents *can and do* win ranked choice elections if enough people vote for them.  Since you lose nothing by voting #1 for whomever you like the most, why wouldn't you?

Secondly, the candidate that wins will know that preferences from Nice Party voters made a big difference in their election and that they'll want to keep Nice Party voters happy enough to get re-elected.  

### How ranked choice voting works with multiple winners:

Of course, the real power of Ranked Choice Voting occurs when there are multiple seats up for election at once.  Right now, the U.S. doesn't use multi-seat voting for federal elections, but a few city councils are elected this way, including Minneapolis, MI, and Cambridge, MA. 

In a multi-winner vote system, the voting in the booth is the same - you rank your candidates 1-2-3, like before.  However, to get elected, candidates need only total votes * 1 / (number of seats + 1), plus one more, to get elected. (This is also true of a single winner election, where the candidates need 1/(1+1) of the total votes + 1.)

The only difference is that candidates who have *more votes than they need* also have their *extra* votes transferred, proportionally to their second choices. ]

Suppose a food election is conducted to determine what three foods will be chosen.  The candidates are Oranges, Pairs, Chocolate, Strawberries, and Sweets. 

The guests vote this way: 

[ 4 ] #1: Orange
[ 2 ] #1: Pear, #2: Orange
[ 8 ] #1: Chocolate, #2: Strawberry
[ 4 ] #1: Chocolate, #2: Sweets
[ 1 ] #1: Strawberry
[ 1 ] #1: Sweets

Since there are 20 votes, and 3 winners to be found, we take the total votes (20), divided by the number of winners + 1 (4) to get 5, plus one vote, to get 6 votes needed to win.  

(First Round)
Chocolate: 12 > ELECTED
Orange: 4,
Pear: 2,
Strawberry: 1,
Sweets: 1,

During the first round, Chocolate has 12 #1 votes.  That's more than enough to get elected, so Chocolate is declared one of the winners.  But since Chocolate only needed 6 votes to win, the other six votes should transfer to their second choices. 

The fairest way, of course, is to do so proportionally, where each second choice candidate gets their votes for second preference divided by the total votes for Chocolate * the number of extra votes Chocolate has. 

So for Strawberry, it would be (8/12) * 6 = 4 votes.  For Sweets, it would be (4/12) * 6 = 2 votes; 

(Second Round)
Chocolate: ELECTED
Orange: 4
Pear: 2,
Strawberry: 1 + 4 = 5
Sweets: 1 + 2 = 3

In this round, no candidate has more than six votes, so the candidate with the lowest votes gets eliminated.  That's Pear, with two votes. 

Pear is eliminated, and all of Pears votes transfer to their second choice.  In this case, both votes go to Orange, who has 6 votes. Since they have *exactly* the right number of votes to be elected, they don't have any votes to transfer. 

(Third Round)
Chocolate: ELECTED
Orange: 4 + 2 = 6 > ELECTED
Pear: ELIMINATED
Strawberry: 5
Sweets: 3

We now have one seat, and two candidates left.  Since neither candidate has 6 votes, we eliminate the candidate with the least votes.  None of the sweets voters have a second preference, but it doesn't really matter, as since we only have one candidate left, and one seat, Strawberry wins the third seat. 

(Final Round)
Chocolate: ELECTED
Orange: ELECTED
Pear: ELIMINATED
Strawberry: ELECTED (By Default)
Sweets: ELIMINATED

### Why is this a better system?  And what does this have to do with gerrymandering?

What's interesting about the Multi-Member Ranked Choice Voting election is that there is much less "vote wastage" - that is, most votes ultimately counted towards *some* representation and were statistically meaningful. In our food example, 6 + 6 + 4, or 17 out of 20 votes eventually went to electing a representative.  Of those 17 votes, 16 votes were *crucial* to getting the results we did.  (Technically, Strawberry could have lost a single vote and still have been elected.)

This is important because currently, our single-winner districts are vulnerable to "gerrymandering."  By drawing the borders in a certain way, the party in power can make it so that they want win a majority of seats, while having a minority of votes.  This is through "cracking" - drawing districts to make sure that no opposition candidate could ever hope to get enough votes to win - or through "packing" - forcing opposition voters into the same district, where the opposition candidate wins in a landslide -- but only get one seat. Whereas if the districts were more fairly spread out, it might have resulted in two opposition seats instead of just the one.  

If extra votes transfer, packing doesn't work, and if there's less votes "wasted" on a losing candidate, then cracking doesn't work.  It's a way to fight gerrymandering, not by requiring independent redistricting committees, but by attacking the very election system that makes gerrymandering possible.  

## How does Ranked Choice Voting work in a Presidential Primary Election? 

Currently, the Republican and Democratic nominees are assigned delegates in proportion to the number of votes they get.  However, both parties have a threshhold of minimum votes that a candidate must pass.  For the Republican primary, that's 10%, for the Democratic primary, it's 15%.  As a result, in an election year, you can end up with a lot of votes divided up among many candidates that result in no delegates being awarded.  Even though the threshhold was only 10% for the Republican primary, for example, 13% of voters voted for a candidate that didn't beat the threshhold.

In the proposed system for the New Hampshire Presidential Primary, both the Republican and Democratic parties would retain their threshholds, but we would use ranked-choice votes to get a list of viable candidates who beat the threshhold. Candidates that don't beat the the threshhold will have their voter's second choices count instead.  That way, every voter gets a say who they want the Presidential nominee of their party to be.  

Let's use a hypothetical NH Democratic Primary among five candidates: 
"Centrist", "Center-Left", "Left", "Far-Left", and "Really-Far-Left"

You could end up with an election that looks like this:

Delegates Available: 26

Centrist: 10 votes
Center-Left: 50 votes
Left: 20 votes
Far-Left: 13 votes
Really-Far-Left: 7 votes

Currently, 30% of voters would be eliminated. Centrists, Far-Left, and Really-Far-Left candidates would not have the 15% they'd needed to pass the threshhold. Center-Left would get 18 delegates, and Left would get 7 delegates. 

However, let's say that the votes went something like this:

[ 10 ] [Centrist, Center-Left, Left];
[ 50 ] [Center-Left, *(other)]
[ 20 ] [Left, *(other)]
[ 6 ] [Far-Left, Left, Really-Far-Left]
[ 7 ] [Far-Left, Really-Far-Left, Left]
[ 7 ] [Really-Far-Left, Far-Left, Left] 

In this election, the Center Left and the Left candidates would be viable right off the bat.  The lowest ranked candidate is "Really-Far-Left", so we eliminate RFL. and we're left with: 

[ 10 ] [Centrist, Center-Left, Left];
[ 50 ] [Center-Left, *(other)]
[ 20 ] [Left, *(other)]
[ 6 ] [Far-Left, Left]
[ 7 ] [Far-Left, Left]
[ 7 ] [Far-Left, Left] 

Since the ballots for [Far-Left, Left] are now the same across the board, we can just add them. 

[ 10 ] [Centrist, Center-Left, Left];
[ 50 ] [Center-Left, *(other)]
[ 20 ] [Left, *(other)]
[ 20 ] [Far-Left, Left]

Now, the Far-Left candidate passes the threshhold.  The Centrist candidate, however, doesn't have enough.  Those 10 votes then transfer to the second choice: Center-Left.

[ 60 ] [Center-Left]
[ 20 ] [Left]
[ 20 ] [Far-Left]

Now we see how the makeup has changed the election.  Center-Left gets 16 delegates, and Left and Far-Left get 5 delegates. More importantly, every single voter is counted and has a say in who the delegate will be.
